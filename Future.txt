[Intro]
What Do we Want to do    ?
Make a Script to do the following :
1-[input] An absolute path for the Folder ;
2-[Process] Dig Deeper inside this folder and Get all sub-folders ...etc and Extract all those data to the Main Folder that was Given in "input"
3-[Output] The Same folder , But Containing NO folders At ALL ! It Only Contains Files So that I don't Need to Dig into each folder and forget WHAT i wanted to Do

-----------------------------
-----------------------------
//// Those are Things To make in Future  ;

The Script Works Fine, But there are a Couple of Problem To work On :
1-Check if the Path is Absolute ;
2-After Extracting Files , The Script Does NOT stop [Fix Bug ]
3-Test it On More Cases  ;
4-Make it OOP design ???

===============================

The Bug is Catched , It happens When Main Folder has No Sub-folders  ;
